# Drawer

The `Drawer` component is a panel that slides out from the edge of the screen. It can be useful to provide access to destinations in your app without leaving the current page.

## Focus

The `Drawer` component is a modal component. It traps focus within the drawer while it is open. When the drawer is closed, focus is returned to the element that had focus before the drawer was opened.
