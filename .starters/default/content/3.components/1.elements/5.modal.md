# Modal

A `Modal` is a component that appears on top of the main content of the page. It is used to display important information or to request user input, while blocking interaction with the rest of the page.

## Focus

`Modal` traps focus within it's content while it is open. When the `Modal` is closed, focus is returned to the element that had focus before the `Modal` was opened.

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `modelValue` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the `Modal` is opened or not. |
